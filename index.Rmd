# Introduction

Welcome to A Tour of Time Series Analysis with `R` 

## About the Authors

????

## About This Book

```{block, type='rmdcomment'}
A few things are missing here:

- Goal of the book:
    - Teaching
    - Research (demo research)
- Mentioned that there was a previous version of the book was used for STAT 429 Time Series Analysis at UIUC. The teaching part of this book is based on a typed up version of my notes.
- I like the text below... :D what do you think?
```

This document is under active development and as a result is likely to contains
many errors. As Montesquieu puts it:

>
> "*La nature semblait avoir sagement pourvu à ce que les sottises des hommes 
> fussent passagères, et les livres les immortalisent.*"

## Contributing

```{block, type='rmdcomment'}
I proposed to remove this section or to considerably modify it.
```
If you notice any errors, we would be grateful if you would let us know. To let
us know about the errors, there are two options available to you. The first and
subsequently the fastest being if you are familiar with GitHub and know 
RMarkdown, then [make a pull request and fix the issue yourself!
](https://github.com/SMAC-Group/TTS). Note, in the online version, there is
even an option to automatically start the pull request by clicking the edit
button in the top-left corner of the text.

```{r ebutton, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/support/edit_button.png")
```

The second option, that will have a slightly slower resolution time is to
send an email to `balamut2 AT illinois DOT edu` that includes: the error and a
possible revision. Please put in the subject header: `[TTS]`.

## Bibliographic Note 

```{block, type='rmdcomment'}
I think this section is OK
```

This text is heavily inspired by the following three execellent references:

1. "*Time Series Analysis and Its Applications*", Third Edition, Robert H. Shumway & David S. Stoffer.
2. "*Time Series for Macroeconomics and Finance*", John H. Cochrane.
3. "*Cours de Séries Temporelles: Théorie et Applications*", Volume 1, Arthur Charpentier.

##  Rendering Mathematical Formulae 

```{block, type='rmdcomment'}
I proposed to remove this section
```

Throughout the book, there will be mathematical symbols used to express the
material. Depending on the version of the book, there are two different render
engines. 

- For the online version, the text uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
to render mathematical notation for the web. In the event the formulae does
not load for a specific chapter, first try to refresh the page. 9 times out of
10 the issue is related to the software library not loading quickly.
- For the pdf version, the text is built using the recommended AMS LaTeX 
symbolic packages. As a result, there should be no issue displaying equations.

An example of a mathematical rendering capabilities would be given as:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]

## R Code Conventions 

```{block, type='rmdcomment'}
I proposed to remove this section
```

The code used throughout the book will predominately be `R` code.  To obtain
a copy of [`R`](https://cloud.r-project.org/), go to the
[Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

When `R` code is displayed it will be typeset using a `monospace` font with 
syntax highlighting enabled to ensure the differentiation of functions,
variables, and so on. For example, the following adds 1 to 1

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a = 1L + 1L
a
```

Each code segment may contain actual output from `R`. Such output will appear
in grey font prefixed by `##`. For example, the output of the above code
segment would look like so:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
a = 1L + 1L
a
```

Alongside the PDF download of the book, you should find the R code used within 
each chapter.
