In this chapter we will discuss and formalize how knowledge about $X_{t-1}$ (or
more generally about all the information from the past $\Omega_t$) can provide 
us with some information about the properties of $X_t$. In particular, we will 
consider the correlation (or covariance) of $(X_t)$ at different times such 
as $\corr \left(X_t, X_{t+h}\right)$. This "form" of correlation (covariance) is
called the *autocorrelation* (*autocovariance*) and is a very useful tool in
time series analysis. However, if we do not assume that a time series is 
characterized by a certain form of "stability", it would be rather difficult 
to estimate $\corr \left(X_t, X_{t+h}\right)$ as this quantity would depend on 
both $t$ and $h$ leading to more parameters to estimate than observations 
available. Therefore, the concept of *stationarity* is convenient in this
context as it allows (among other things) to assume that

\[\corr \left(X_t, X_{t+h}\right) = \corr \left(X_{t+j}, X_{t+h+j}\right), \;\;\; \text{for all $j$},\]

implying that the autocorrelation (or autocovariance) is only a function of the
lag between observations (rather than time itself). These two concepts (i.e. 
autocorrelation and stationarity) will be discussed in this chapter. Before 
moving on, it is helpful to remember that correlation (or autocorrelation) is
only appropriate to measure a very specific kind of dependence, i.e. the linear
dependence. There are many other forms of dependence as illustrated in the
bottom panels of the graph below, which all have a (true) zero correlation:

```{r correxample, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Different forms of dependence and their Pearson's r value", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/corr_example.png")
```

Several other metrics have been introduced in the literature to assess the
degree of "dependence" of two random variables however this goes beyond the
material discussed in this chapter.

## The Autocorrelation and Autocovariance Functions 

```{definition, label="acvf"}
The *autocovariance function* of a series $(X_t)$ is defined as 

\[{\gamma_x}\left( {t,t+h} \right) = \cov \left( {{X_t},{X_{t+h}}} \right),\]
```

where the definition of covariance is given by:

\[
  \cov \left( {{X_t},{X_{t+h}}} \right) = \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}{X_{t+h}}} \right] - \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}} \right]\mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_{t+h}}} \right].
 \]
  
Similarly, the above expectations are defined to be:

\[\begin{aligned}
  \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}} \right] &= \int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {x \cdot {f_t}\left( x \right)dx},  \\
  \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}{X_{t+h}}} \right] &= \int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {\int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {{x_1}{x_2} \cdot f_{t,t+h}\left( {{x_1},{x_2}} \right)d{x_1}d{x_2}} } ,
\end{aligned} \]

where ${f_t}\left( x \right)$ and $f_{t,t+h}\left( {{x_1},{x_2}} \right)$ denote,
respectively, the density of $X_t$ and the joint density of the 
pair $(X_t, X_{t+h})$. Since we generally consider stochastic processes with
constant zero mean we often have

\[{\gamma_x}\left( {t,t+h} \right) = \mathbb{E}\left[X_t X_{t+h} \right]. \]

In addition, we normally drop the subscript referring to the time
series (i.e. $x$ in this case) if it is clear from the context which time
series the autocovariance refers to. For example, we generally 
use ${\gamma}\left( {t,t+h} \right)$ instead
of ${\gamma_x}\left( {t,t+h} \right)$. Moreover, the notation is even further
simplified when the covariance of $X_t$ and $X_{t+h}$ is the same as that
of $X_{t+j}$ and $X_{t+h+j}$ (for all $j$), i.e. the covariance depends only 
on the time between observations and not on the specific time $t$. This is an 
important property called *stationarity*, which will be discuss in the next
section. In this case, we simply use to following notation:
\[\gamma \left( {h} \right) = \cov \left( X_t , X_{t+h} \right). \]

This notation will generally be used throughout the text and implicitly assume 
certain properties (i.e. stationarity) on the process $(X_t)$. 
Several remarks can be made on the autocovariance:

1. The autocovariance function is *symmetric*. 
   That is, ${\gamma}\left( {h} \right) = {\gamma}\left( -h \right)$ 
   since $\cov \left( {{X_t},{X_{t+h}}} \right) = \cov \left( X_{t+h},X_{t} \right)$.
2. The autocovariance function "contains" the variance of the process 
   as $\var \left( X_{t} \right) = {\gamma}\left( 0 \right)$.
3. We have that $|\gamma(h)| \leq \gamma(0)$ for all $h$. The proof of this 
   inequality is direct and follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, i.e.
\[ \begin{aligned}
\left(|\gamma(h)| \right)^2 &= \gamma(h)^2 = \left(\mathbb{E}\left[\left(X_t - \mathbb{E}[X_t] \right)\left(X_{t+h} - \mathbb{E}[X_{t+h}] \right)\right]\right)^2\\
&\leq \mathbb{E}\left[\left(X_t - \mathbb{E}[X_t] \right)^2 \right] \mathbb{E}\left[\left(X_{t+h} - \mathbb{E}[X_{t+h}] \right)^2 \right] =  \gamma(0)^2. 
\end{aligned}
\] 
4. Just as any covariance, ${\gamma}\left( {h} \right)$ is "scale dependent"
   since ${\gamma}\left( {h} \right) \in \real$, 
   or $-\infty \le {\gamma}\left( {h} \right) \le +\infty$. We therefore have:
    - if $\left| {\gamma}\left( {h} \right) \right|$ is "close" to zero, 
      then $X_t$ and $X_{t+h}$ are "weakly" (linearly) dependent;
    - if $\left| {\gamma}\left( {h} \right) \right|$ is "far" from zero, 
      then the two random variable present a "strong" (linear) dependence. 
      However it is generally difficult to asses what "close" and "far" from 
      zero means in this case. 
5. ${\gamma}\left( {h} \right)=0$ does not imply that $X_t$ and $X_{t+h}$ are 
   independent but simply $X_t$ and $X_{t+h}$ are uncorrelated. 
   The independence is only implied by ${\gamma}\left( {h} \right)=0$ in
   the jointly Gaussian case.

As hinted in the introduction, an important related statistic is the correlation
of $X_t$ with $X_{t+h}$ or *autocorrelation*, which is defined as

$$\rho \left(  h \right) = \corr\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \right) = \frac{{\cov\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \right)}}{{{\sigma _{{X_t}}}{\sigma _{{X_{t + h}}}}}} = \frac{\gamma(h) }{\gamma(0)}.$$

Similarly to $\gamma(h)$, it is important to note that the above notation 
implies that the autocorrelation function is only a function of the 
lag $h$ between observations. Thus, autocovariances and autocorrelations are one
possible way to describe the joint distribution of a time series. Indeed, the 
correlation of $X_t$ with $X_{t+1}$ is an obvious measure of how *persistent* a
time series is. 

Remember that just as with any correlation:

1. $\rho \left( h \right)$ is "scale free" so it is much easier to interpret 
   than $\gamma(h)$.
2. $|\rho \left( h \right)| \leq 1$ since $|\gamma(h)| \leq \gamma(0)$.
3. **Causation and correlation are two very different things!**

### A Fundamental Representation

Autocovariances and autocorrelations also turn out to be very useful tools as
they are one of the *fundamental representations* of time series. Indeed, if we
consider a zero mean normally distributed process, it is clear that its joint
distribution is fully characterized by the 
autocovariances $\mathbb{E}[X_t X_{t+h}]$ (since the joint probability density
only depends of these covariances). Once we know the autocovariances we
know *everything* there is to know about the process and therefore:

*if two processes have the same autocovariance function, then they are the 
same process.*

### Admissible Autocorrelation Functions

Since the autocorrelation is related to a fundamental representation of time
series, it implies that one might be able to define a stochastic process by 
picking a set of autocorrelation values (assuming for example
that $\var(X_t) = 1$). However, it turns out that not every collection of
numbers, say $\{\rho_1, \rho_2, ...\}$, can represent the autocorrelation of a
process. Indeed, two conditions are required to ensure the validity of an
autocorrelation sequence:

1. $\operatorname{max}_j \; | \rho_j| \leq 1$.
2. $\var \left[\sum_{j = 0}^\infty \alpha_j X_{t-j} \right] \geq 0 \;$ for all $\{\alpha_0, \alpha_1, ...\}$.

The first condition is obvious and simply reflects the fact 
that $|\rho \left( h \right)| \leq 1$ but the second is far more difficult to
verify. To further our understanding of the latter we let $\alpha_j = 0$ for $j > 1$,
then condition 2 implies that

\[\var \left[ \alpha_0 X_{t} + \alpha_1 X_{t-1}  \right] = \gamma_0 \begin{bmatrix}
  \alpha_0 & \alpha_1
 \end{bmatrix}   \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & \rho_1\\
  \rho_1 & 1
 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
  \alpha_0 \\
  \alpha_1
 \end{bmatrix} \geq 0. \]
 
Thus, the matrix 
 
 \[ \boldsymbol{A}_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & \rho_1\\
  \rho_1 & 1
 \end{bmatrix} \]
 
must be positive semi-definite. Taking the determinant we have 
 
 \[\operatorname{det} \left(\boldsymbol{A}_1\right) = 1 - \rho_1^2 \]

implying that the condition $|\rho_1| \leq 1$ must be respected. 
Now, let $\alpha_j = 0$ for $j > 2$, then we must verify that:

\[\var \left[ \alpha_0 X_{t} + \alpha_1 X_{t-1}  + \alpha_2 X_{t-2} \right] = \gamma_0 \begin{bmatrix}
  \alpha_0 & \alpha_1 &\alpha_2
 \end{bmatrix}   \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & \rho_1 & \rho_2\\
  \rho_1 & 1 & \rho_1 \\
  \rho_2 & \rho_1 & 1
 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
  \alpha_0 \\
  \alpha_1 \\
  \alpha_2
 \end{bmatrix} \geq 0. \]

Again, this implies that the matrix

 \[ \boldsymbol{A}_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & \rho_1 & \rho_2\\
  \rho_1 & 1 & \rho_1 \\
  \rho_2 & \rho_1 & 1
 \end{bmatrix} \]
 
must be positive semi-definite and it is easy to verify that
 
 \[\operatorname{det} \left(\boldsymbol{A}_2\right) = \left(1 - \rho_2 \right)\left(- 2 \rho_1^2 + \rho_2 + 1\right). \]

Thus, this implies that 

\[\begin{aligned} &- 2 \rho_1^2 + \rho_2 + 1 \geq 0 \Rightarrow 1 \geq \rho_2 \geq 2 \rho_1^2 - 1 \\
&\Rightarrow 1 - \rho_1^2 \geq \rho_2 - \rho_1^2 \geq -(1 - \rho_1^2)\\
&\Rightarrow 1 \geq \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1^2 }{1 - \rho_1^2} \geq -1.
\end{aligned}\]

Therefore, $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ must lie in a parabolic shaped region defined
by the above inequalities as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:admissibility).

```{r admissibility, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Admissible autocorrelation functions", fig.align='center', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
```

From our derivation it is clear that the restrictions on the autocorrelation are
very complicated thereby justifying the need for other forms of fundamental 
representation which we will explore later in this text. Before moving on to
the estimation of the autocorrelation and autocovariance functions, we must 
first discuss the stationarity of $(X_t)$, which will provide a convenient 
framework in which $\gamma(h)$ and $\rho(h)$ can be used (rather 
that $\gamma(t,t+h)$ for example) and (easily) estimated.

## Stationarity {#stationary}

There are two kinds of stationarity that are commonly used. They are defined 
as follows:

```{definition, label="strongstationarity"}
A process $(X_t)$ is *strongly stationary* or *strictly stationary* if the joint probability distribution of $(X_{t-h}, ..., X_t, ..., X_{t+h})$ is independent of $t$ for all $h$.
```

```{definition, label="weakstationarity"}
A process $(X_t)$ is *weakly stationary*, *covariance stationary* or *second order stationary* if $\mathbb{E}[X_t]$, $\mathbb{E}[X_t^2]$ are finite and $\mathbb{E}[X_t X_{t-h}]$ depends only on $h$ and not on $t$.
```

These types of stationarity are *not equivalent* and the presence of one kind 
of stationarity does not imply the other. That is, a time series can be strongly
stationary but not weakly stationary and vice versa. In some cases, a time 
series can be both strongly and weakly stationary and this is occurs, for 
example, in the (jointly) Gaussian case. Stationarity of $(X_t)$ matters
because *it provides the framework in which averaging dependent data makes
sense* thereby allowing to easily estimate quantities such as the 
autocorrelation function.

Several remarks and comments can be made on these definitions:

- As mentioned earlier, strong stationarity *does not imply* weak stationarity. 

```{example, label="strongnotweak"}
an iid Cauchy process is strongly but not weakly stationary.
```

- Weak stationarity *does not imply* strong stationarity. 

```{example, label="weaksplit"}
Consider the following weak white noise process:
\begin{equation*}
X_t = \begin{cases}
    U_{t}      & \quad \text{if } t \in \{2k:\, k\in \mathbb{Z} \}, \\
    V_{t}      & \quad \text{if } t \in \{2k+1:\, k\in \mathbb{Z} \},\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where ${U_t} \mathop \sim \limits^{iid} N\left( {1,1} \right)$ and ${V_t}\mathop \sim \limits^{iid} \mathcal{E}\left( 1 \right)$ is a weakly stationary process that is *not* strongly stationary.
```

- Strong stationarity combined with bounded values of $\mathbb{E}[X_t]$ 
  and $\mathbb{E}[X_t^2]$ *implies* weak stationarity
- Weak stationarity combined with normality distributed processes *implies* 
  strong stationarity.

### Assessing Weak Stationarity of Time Series Models

It is important to understand how to verify if a postulated model is (weakly)
stationary. In order to do so, we must ensure that our model satisfies the
following three properties:

1. $\mathbb{E}\left[X_t \right] = \mu_t = \mu < \infty$,
2. $\var\left[X_t \right] = \sigma^2_t = \sigma^2 < \infty$,
3. $\cov\left(X_t, X_{t+h} \right) = \gamma \left(h\right)$.

In the following examples we evaluate the stationarity of the processes
introduced in Section \@ref(basicmodels).

```{example, label="gwn", name = "Gaussian White Noise"} 
It is easy to verify that this process is stationary. Indeed, we have:

1. $\mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}} \right] = 0$,
2. $\gamma(0) = \sigma^2 < \infty$,  
3. $\gamma(h) = 0$ for $|h| > 0$.

```

```{example, label="srw", name = "Random Walk"}
To evaluate the stationarity of this process we first derive its properties:

1. We begin by calculating the expectation of the process
\[
  \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}} \right] = \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_{t - 1}} + {W_t}} \right] 
   = \mathbb{E}\left[ {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}}  + {X_0}} \right] 
   = \mathbb{E}\left[ {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}} } \right] + {c} 
   = c.  \] 
Observe that the mean obtained is constant since it depends only on the value
of the first term in the sequence.

2. Next, after finding the mean to be constant, we calculate the variance to check stationarity:
\[\begin{aligned}
  \var\left( {{X_t}} \right) &= \var\left( {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_t}}  + {X_0}} \right) 
   = \var\left( {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}} } \right) + \underbrace {\var\left( {{X_0}} \right)}_{= 0} \\
   &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {\var\left( {{W_i}} \right)} 
   = t \sigma_w^2,
\end{aligned}\] 
where $\sigma_w^2 = \var(W_t)$. Therefore, the variance depends on time $t$ contradicting our
second property. Moreover, we have:
\[\mathop {\lim }\limits_{t \to \infty } \; \var\left(X_t\right) = \infty.\]
This process is therefore not weakly stationary.

3. Regarding the autocovariance of a random walk we have:
\[\begin{aligned}
  \gamma \left( h \right) &= \cov\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \right) 
   = \cov\left( {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}} ,\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{t + h} {{W_j}} } \right) 
   = \cov\left( {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}} ,\sum\limits_{j = 1}^t {{W_j}} } \right)\\ 
   &= \min \left( {t,t + h} \right)\sigma _w^2
   = \left( {t + \min \left( {0,h} \right)} \right)\sigma _w^2,
\end{aligned} \]
which further illustrates the non-stationarity of this process.

Moreover, the autocorrelation of this process is given by

\[\rho (h) = \frac{t + \min \left( {0,h} \right)}{\sqrt{t}\sqrt{t+h}},\]

implying (for a fixed $h$) that

\[\mathop {\lim }\limits_{t \to \infty } \; \rho(h) = 1.\]
```

In the following simulated example, we illustrate the non-stationary feature of
such a process:

```{r RWsim, cache = TRUE, fig.cap = "Two hundred simulated random walks.", fig.align='center', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
```

In the plot, two hundred simulated random walks are plotted along with the
theoretical 95% confidence intervals (red-dashed lines). The relationship
between time and variance can clearly be observed (i.e. the variance of the 
process increases with the time).

```{example, label="exma1", name = "Moving Average of Order 1"}

Similarly to our previous examples, we attempt to verify the stationary 
properties for the MA(1) model defined in Section \@ref(ma1):
  
1. \[ 
  \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}} \right] = \mathbb{E}\left[ {{\theta_1}{W_{t - 1}} + {W_t}} \right] 
   = {\theta_1} \mathbb{E} \left[ {{W_{t - 1}}} \right] + \mathbb{E}\left[ {{W_t}} \right] 
   = 0. \] 
2. \[\var \left( {{X_t}} \right) = \theta_1^2 \var \left( W_{t - 1}\right) + \var \left( W_{t}\right) = \left(1 + \theta^2 \right) \sigma^2_w.\]  
3. Regarding the autocovariance, we have 
\[\begin{aligned}
  \cov\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \right) &= \mathbb{E}\left[ {\left( {{X_t} - \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}} \right]} \right)\left( {{X_{t + h}} - \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_{t + h}}} \right]} \right)} \right] = \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}{X_{t + h}}} \right] \\
   &= \mathbb{E}\left[ {\left( {{\theta}{W_{t - 1}} + {W_t}} \right)\left( {{\theta }{W_{t + h - 1}} + {W_{t + h}}} \right)} \right] \\
   &= \mathbb{E}\left[ {\theta^2{W_{t - 1}}{W_{t + h - 1}} + \theta {W_t}{W_{t + h}} + {\theta}{W_{t - 1}}{W_{t + h}} + {W_t}{W_{t + h}}} \right]. \\
  \end{aligned} \] 
It is easy to see that $\mathbb{E}\left[ {{W_t}{W_{t + h}}} \right] = {\boldsymbol{1}_{\left\{ {h = 0} \right\}}}\sigma _w^2$ and therefore, we obtain
\[\cov \left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \right) = \left( {\theta^2{ \boldsymbol{1}_{\left\{ {h = 0} \right\}}} + {\theta}{\boldsymbol{1}_{\left\{ {h = 1} \right\}}} + {\theta}{\boldsymbol{1}_{\left\{ {h =  - 1} \right\}}} + {\boldsymbol{1}_{\left\{ {h = 0} \right\}}}} \right)\sigma _w^2\] 
implying the following autocovariance function:
\[\gamma \left( h \right) = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
  {\left( {\theta^2 + 1} \right)\sigma _w^2}&{h = 0} \\ 
  {{\theta}\sigma _w^2}&{\left| h \right| = 1} \\ 
  0&{\left| h \right| > 1} 
  \end{array}} \right. .\]
Therefore, an MA(1) process is weakly stationary since both the mean and variance are constant over time and its covariance function is only a function of the lag $h$. Finally, we can easily obtain the autocorrelation for this process, which is given by
$$\rho \left( h \right) = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
  1&{h = 0} \\ 
  {\frac{{{\theta}\sigma _w^2}}{{\left( {\theta^2 + 1} \right)\sigma _w^2}} = \frac{{{\theta}}}{{\theta^2 + 1}}}&{\left| h \right| = 1} \\ 
  0&{\left| h \right| > 1} 
\end{array}} \right. .$$
Interestingly, we can note that $|\rho(1)| \leq 0.5$.

```

```{example, label="exar1", name = "Autoregressive of Order 1"}
As another example, we shall verify the stationary properties for the AR(1)
model defined in Section \@ref(ar1).

Using the *backsubstitution* technique, we can rearrange an AR(1) process so 
that it is written in a more compact form, i.e.

\[\begin{aligned}
  {X_t} & =  {\phi }{X_{t - 1}} + {W_t} = \phi \left[ {\phi {X_{t - 2}} + {W_{t - 1}}} \right] + {W_t} 
    =  {\phi ^2}{X_{t - 2}} + \phi {W_{t - 1}} + {W_t}  \\
   &  \vdots  \\
   & =  {\phi ^k}{X_{t-k}} + \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} {{\phi ^j}{W_{t - j}}} .
\end{aligned} \]

By taking the limit in $k$ (which is perfectly valid as we 
assume $t \in \mathbb{Z}$) and assuming $|\phi|<1$, we obtain

\[\begin{aligned}
  X_t = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{k \to \infty} \; {X_t}  =  \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{\infty} {{\phi ^j}{W_{t - j}}} 
\end{aligned} \]

and therefore such process can be interpreted as a linear combination of the 
white noise $(W_t)$ and corresponds (as we will later on) to an MA($\infty$). 
In addition, the requirement $\left| \phi  \right| < 1$ turns out to be 
extremely useful as the above formula is related to Geometric series which
would diverge if $\phi \geq 1$. Indeed, remember that
an infinite (converging) Geometric series is given by

\[\sum\limits_{k = 0}^\infty  \, a{{r^k}}  = \frac{a}{{1 - r}}, \; {\text{ if }}\left| r \right| < 1.\]

<!--
The origin of the requirement comes from needing to ensure that the characteristic polynomial solution for an AR1 lies outside of the unit circle. Subsequently, stability enables the process to be stationary. If $\phi  \ge 1$, the process would not converge. Under the requirement, the process can represented as a 
-->

With this setup, we demonstrate how crucial this property is by calculating each
of the requirements of a stationary process.

1. First, we will check if the mean is stationary. 
   In this case, we opt to use limits to derive the expectation
\[\begin{aligned}
  \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}} \right] &= \mathop {\lim }\limits_{k \to \infty } \mathbb{E}\left[ {{\phi^k}{X_{t-k}} + \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} {\phi^j{W_{t - j}}} } \right] \\
   &= \mathop {\lim }\limits_{k \to \infty } \, \underbrace {{\phi ^k}{\mathbb{E}[X_{t-k}]}}_{= 0} + \mathop {\lim }\limits_{k \to \infty } \, \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} {\phi^j\underbrace {\mathbb{E}\left[ {{W_{t - j}}} \right]}_{ = 0}}
   = 0.
\end{aligned} \] As expected, the mean is zero and, hence, the first criteria for weak stationarity is satisfied. 
2. Next, we opt to determine the variance of the process
\[\begin{aligned}
\var\left( {{X_t}} \right) &= \mathop {\lim }\limits_{k \to \infty } \var\left( {{\phi^k}{X_{t-k}} + \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} {\phi^j{W_{t - j}}} } \right)
   = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{k \to \infty } \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} {\phi ^{2j} \var\left( {{W_{t - j}}} \right)}  \\
   &= \mathop {\lim }\limits_{k \to \infty } \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} \sigma _W^2 \, {\phi ^{2j}}  =  
  \underbrace {\frac{\sigma _W^2}{{1 - {\phi ^2}}}.}_{\begin{subarray}{l} 
  {\text{Geom. Serie}} 
\end{subarray}}
\end{aligned} \] Once again, the above result only holds because we are able to use the geometric series convergence as a result of $\left| \phi  \right| < 1$.
3. Finally, we consider the autocovariance of an AR(1). For $h > 0$, we have
\[\gamma \left( h \right) =  \cov\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \right) = \phi \cov\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h - 1}}} \right) = \phi \, \gamma \left( h-1 \right).\]
Therefore, we using the symmetry of the autocovariance we have that
\[\gamma \left( h \right) = \phi^{|h|} \, \gamma(0).\]

Both the mean and variance do not depend on time in addition the autocovariance function can be viewed as function dependent on only lags and, thus, the AR(1) process is weakly stationary if $\left| \phi  \right| < 1$.  Lastly, we can obtain the autocorrelation for this process. Indeed, for $h > 0$, we have

\[\rho \left( h \right) = \frac{{\gamma \left( h \right)}}{{\gamma \left( 0 \right)}} = \frac{{\phi \gamma \left( {h - 1} \right)}}{{\gamma \left( 0 \right)}} = \phi \rho \left( {h - 1} \right).\]

After fully simplifying, we obtain

\[\rho \left( h \right) = {\phi^{|h|}}.\]

Thus, the autocorrelation function for an AR(1) exhibits a _geometric decay_,
meaning, the smaller the $|\phi|$, the faster the autocorrelation reaches zero. 
If $|\phi|$ is close to 1, then the decay rate is slower.

## Estimation of Moments of Stationary Processes

In this section, we discuss how moments and related quantities of stationary
process can be estimated. Informally speaking, the use of "averages" is 
meaningful for such processes suggesting that classical moments estimators can
be employed. Indeed, suppose that one is interested in 
estimating $\alpha \equiv \mathbb{E}[m (X_t)]$, where $m(\cdot)$ is a known
function of $X_t$. If $(X_t)$ is a strongly stationary process, we have

\[\alpha = \int m(x) \, f(x) dx\]

where $f(x)$ denotes the density of $(X_t), \; \forall t$. Replacing $f(x)$ by
$f_n(x)$, the empirical density, we obtain the following estimator

\[\hat{\alpha} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n m\left(x_i\right).\]

In the next subsection, we examine how this simple idea can be used to estimate
the mean, autocovariance and autocorrelation functions. Moreover, we discuss
some of the properties of these estimators.


### Estimation of the Mean Function

If a time series is stationary, the mean function is constant and a possible
estimator of this quantity is, as discussed above, given by

\[\bar{X} = {\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t}} }.\]

Naturally, the $k$-th moment, say $\beta_k \equiv \mathbb{E}[X_t^k]$ can be
estimated by

\[\hat{\beta}_k = {\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t^k}} }, \;\; k \in \left\{x \in \mathbb{N} : \, 0 < x < \infty  \right\}.\]

The variance of such estimator can be derived as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \var \left( \hat{\beta}_k \right) &= \var \left( {\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t^k}} } \right)  \\
   &= \frac{1}{{{n^2}}}\var \left( {{{\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
  1& \cdots &1
\end{array}} \right]}_{1 \times n}}{{\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
  {{X_1^k}} \\
   \vdots  \\
  {{X_n^k}}
\end{array}} \right]}_{n \times 1}}} \right)  \\
   &= \frac{1}{{{n^2}}}{\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
  1& \cdots &1
\end{array}} \right]_{1 \times n}} \, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}(k) \, {\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
  1 \\
   \vdots  \\
  1
\end{array}} \right]_{n \times 1}}, 
\end{aligned}
(\#eq:chap2VarMoment)
\end{equation}

where $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}(k) \in \real^{n \times n}$ and its $i$th, $j$-th
element is given by

\[ \left(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}(k)\right)_{i,j} = \cov \left(X_i^k, X_j^k\right).\]

In the case $k = 1$, (\@ref(eq:chap2VarMoment)) can easily be further simplified.
Indeed, we have

\[\begin{aligned}
  \var \left( {\bar X} \right) &= \var \left( {\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t}} } \right)  \\
   &= \frac{1}{{{n^2}}}{\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
  1& \cdots &1
\end{array}} \right]_{1 \times n}}\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
  {\gamma \left( 0 \right)}&{\gamma \left( 1 \right)}& \cdots &{\gamma \left( {n - 1} \right)} \\
  {\gamma \left( 1 \right)}&{\gamma \left( 0 \right)}&{}& \vdots  \\
   \vdots &{}& \ddots & \vdots  \\
  {\gamma \left( {n - 1} \right)}& \cdots & \cdots &{\gamma \left( 0 \right)}
\end{array}} \right]_{n \times n}{\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
  1 \\
   \vdots  \\
  1
\end{array}} \right]_{n \times 1}}  \\
   &= \frac{1}{{{n^2}}}\left( {n\gamma \left( 0 \right) + 2\left( {n - 1} \right)\gamma \left( 1 \right) + 2\left( {n - 2} \right)\gamma \left( 2 \right) +  \cdots  + 2\gamma \left( {n - 1} \right)} \right)  \\
   &= \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{h =  - n}^n {\left( {1 - \frac{{\left| h \right|}}{n}} \right)\gamma \left( h \right)} .  \\
\end{aligned} \]

Obviously, when the $(X_t)$ is a white noise, the above formula reduces to the
usual $\var \left( {\bar X} \right) = \sigma^2_w/n$. In the following example,
we consider the case of an AR(1) process and discussed 
how $\var \left( {\bar X} \right)$ can be obtained or estimated.

```{example, label="exactvbootstrap"}
For an AR(1) we have $\gamma(h) = \phi^h \sigma_w^2 \left(1 - \phi^2\right)^{-1}$,
therefore, we obtain (after some computations):

\begin{equation}
\var \left( {\bar X} \right) = \frac{\sigma_w^2 \left( n - 2\phi - n \phi^2 + 2 \phi^{n + 1}\right)}{n^2\left(1-\phi^2\right)\left(1-\phi\right)^2}.
\end{equation}

Unfortunately, deriving such an exact formula is often difficult when considering
more complex models. However, asymptotic approximations are often employed to
simplify the calculation. For example, in our case we have

\[\mathop {\lim }\limits_{n \to \infty } \; n \var \left( {\bar X} \right) = \frac{\sigma_w^2}{\left(1-\phi\right)^2},\]

providing the following approximate formula:

\[\var \left( {\bar X} \right) \approx \frac{\sigma_w^2}{n \left(1-\phi\right)^2}.\]

Alternatively, simulation methods can also be employed. For example, a possible
strategy would be parametric bootstrap.
```

```{theorem, label="parabootstrap", "Parametric Bootstrap"}
1. Simulate a new sample under the postulated model, 
   i.e. $X_t^* \sim F_{\btheta}$ (*note:* if $\btheta$ is unknown it can be
   replace by $\hat{\btheta}$, a suitable estimator).
2. Compute the statistics of interest on the simulated 
   sample $(X_t^*)$.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 $B$ times where $B$ is sufficiently "large" 
   (typically $100 \leq B \leq 10000$).
4. Compute the empirical variance of the statistics of interest based on 
   the $B$ independent replications. 
```

In our example, we would consider $(X_t^*)$ to be ${\bar{X}^*}$ and seek to
obtain:

\[\hat{\sigma}^2_B = \frac{1}{B-1} \sum_{i = 1}^B \left(\bar{X}^*_i - \bar{X}^* \right)^2, \;\;\; \text{where} \;\;\; \bar{X}^* = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^B \bar{X}^*_i,\]

and where $\bar{X}^*_i$ denotes the value of the mean estimated on the $i$-th 
simulated sample.

The figure below generated by the following code compares these three methods
for $n = 10$, $B = 1000$, $\sigma^2 = 1$ and a grid of values for $\phi$ going
from $-0.95$ to $0.95$:


```{r estimXbar, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
```

It can be observed that the variance of $\bar{X}$ typically increases with 
the $\phi$. As expected when $\phi = 0$ we have $\var(\bar{X}) = 1/n$ as in 
this case the process is a white noise. Moreover, the bootstrap approach 
appears to approximate well the curve of (\@ref(eq:chap2_exAR1)) while the
asymptotic formula provides a reasonable approximate for $\phi$ being between
-0.5 and 0.5. Naturally, the quality of this approximation would be far better
for larger sample size (here we consider $n = 10$, which is a little "extreme").

### Sample Autocovariance and Autocorrelation Functions

A natural estimator of the *autocovariance function* is given by:

\[\hat \gamma \left( h \right) = \frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^{T - h} {\left( {{X_t} - \bar X} \right)\left( {{X_{t + h}} - \bar X} \right)} \]

leading the following "plug-in" estimator of the *autocorrelation function*

\[\hat \rho \left( h \right) = \frac{{\hat \gamma \left( h \right)}}{{\hat \gamma \left( 0 \right)}}.\]

A graphical representation of the autocorrelation function is often the first
step for any time series analysis (again assuming the process to be stationary).
Consider the following simulated example:

```{r basicACF, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4.5, fig.width = 7}
```

In this example, the true autocorrelation is equal to zero at any 
lag $h \neq 0$ but obviously the estimated autocorrelations are random variables
and are not equal to their true values. It would therefore be useful to have
some knowledge about the variability of the sample autocorrelations (under some
conditions) to assess whether the data comes from a completely random series or
presents some significant correlation at some lags. The following result
provides an asymptotic solution to this problem:

```{theorem, label="approxnormal"}
If $X_t$ is a strong white noise with finite fourth moment,
then $\hat{\rho}(h)$ is approximately normally distributed with mean $0$ and 
variance $n^{-1}$ for all fixed $h$.
```

The proof of this Theorem is given in Appendix \@ref(appendixa).

Using this result, we now have an approximate method to assess whether peaks in
the sample autocorrelation are significant by determining whether the observed
peak lies outside the interval $\pm 2/\sqrt{T}$ (i.e. an approximate 95%
confidence interval). Returning to our previous example and adding confidence
bands in the previous graph, we obtain:

```{r basicACF2, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4.5, fig.width = 7}
```

It can now be observed that most peaks lie within the 
interval $\pm 2/\sqrt{T}$ suggesting that the true data generating process 
is uncorrelated.

```{example, label = "acffeatures"}
To illustrate how the autocorrelation function can be used to reveal some
"features" of a time series we download the level of the Standard & Poor's 500
index, often abbreviated as the S&P 500. This financial index is based on the
market capitalization of 500 large companies having common stock listed on
the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. The graph below 
shows the index level and daily returns from 1990.
```

```{r GSPC, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```

From these graphs it is clear that the returns are not identically distributed
as the variance seems to vary with time and clusters with either high or low 
volatility can be observed. These characteristic of financial time series is 
well known and in the Chapter 5, we will discuss how the variance of such 
process can be approximated. Nevertheless, we compute the empirical
autocorrelation function of the S&P 500 return to evaluate the degree 
of "linear" dependence between observation. The graph below presents 
the empirical autocorrelation.

```{r GSPCacf, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4.5, fig.width = 7, warning = FALSE}
```

As expected, the autocorrelation is small but it might be reasonable to believe
that this sequence is not purely uncorrelated.

Unfortunately, Theorem 1 is based on asymptotic argument and therefore the
confidence bands constructed are also asymptotic and there are no "exact" tools
that can be used in this case. To study the validity of this results when $n$ is
"small" we performed a simulation. In the latter, we simulated processes
following from a Gaussian white noise and examine the empirical distribution of
$\hat{\rho}(3)$ with different sample sizes (i.e. $n$ is set to 5, 10, 30 and
300). Intuitively, the "quality" of of the approximation provided by Theorem
should increase with the sample size $n$. The code below perform such simulation
and compares the empirical distribution of $\sqrt{n} \hat{\rho}(3)$ with a
normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, i.e. its asymptotic
distribution, which is depicted using a red line.

```{r simulationACF, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 7}
```

As expected, it can clearly be observed that the asymptotic approximation is
quite poor when $n = 5$ but as the sample size increases the approximation
improves and is very close when, for example, $n = 300$. This simulation could
suggest that Theorem 1 provides a relatively "close" approximation of the
distribution of $\hat{\rho}(h)$.

### Robustness Issues

<!-- Rob I am sure you would be great to extent this section! I add a small simulation as an example -->

The data generating process delivers a theoretical autocorrelation
(autocovariance) function that, as explained in the previous section,
can then be estimated through the sample autocorrelation (autocovariance)
functions. However, in practice, the sample is often issued from a data 
generating process that is "close" to the true one, meaning that the sample
suffers from some form of small contamination. This contamination is typically
represented by a small amount of extreme observations that are called "outliers"
that come from a process that is different from the true data generating process.

The fact that the sample can suffer from outliers implies that the standard
estimation of the autocorrelation (autocovariance) functions through the sample
functions could be highly biased. The standard estimators presented in the
previous section are therefore not "robust" and can behave badly when the sample
suffers from contamination. To illustrate this limitation of classical estimator
we consider the following two processes:

\[ 
\begin{aligned}
          X_t &= \phi X_{t-1} + W_t, \;\;\; W_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_w^2),\\
					Y_t &= \begin{cases}
				    X_t       & \quad \text{with probability } 1 - \epsilon\\
				    U_t  & \quad \text{with probability } \epsilon\\
				  \end{cases}, \;\;\; U_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_u^2),
\end{aligned}
\] 
	
when $\epsilon$ is "small" and $\sigma_u^2 \gg \sigma_w^2$, the process $(Y_t)$
can be interpreted as a "contaminated" version of $(X_t)$. The figure below
represents one relalization of the processes $(X_t)$ and $(Y_t)$ using the 
following setting: $n = 100$, $\sigma_u^2 = 10$, $\phi = 0,5$, $\sigma_w^2 = 1$ as 
well as $\alpha = 0.05$.

```{r XtYt, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7}
```

Next, we consider a simulated example to highlight how the performance of the
"classical" autocorrelation can deteriorate if the sample is contaminated (i.e.
what is the impact of using $(Y_t)$ instead of $(X_t)$, the "uncontaminated" 
process). In this simulation, we used the setting presented above and
consider $B = 10^3$ bootstrap replications.

```{r simulationRobust, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 7}
```

The boxplots in each figure show how the standard autocorrelation estimator is
centered around the true value (red line) when the sample is not 
contaminated (left boxplot) while it is considerably biased when the sample is
contaminated (right boxplot), especially at the smallest lags. Indeed, it can 
be seen how the boxplots under contamination are often close to zero indicating 
that it does not detect much dependence in the data although it should. This is 
a known result in robustness, more specifically that outliers in the data can 
break the dependence structure and make it more difficult for the latter to be
detected.

In order to limit this problematic, different robust estimators exist for time
series problems allowing to reduce the impact of contamination on the estimation
procedure. Among these estimators there are a few that estimate the
autocorrelation (autocovariance) functions in a robust manner. One of these 
estimators is provided in the ``robacf()`` function in the "robcor" package and 
the following simulated example shows how it limits the bias due to
contamination. Unlike in the previous simulation, we only consider in this 
example data issued from the contaminated model, i.e. $(Y_t)$, and compare the 
performance of two estimators (i.e. classical and robust 
autocorrelation estimators):

```{r simulationRobust2, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 7}
```

The robust estimator remains close to the true value represented by the red line
in the boxplots as opposed to the standard estimator. It can also be observed 
that to reduce the bias induced by contamination in the sample, robust
estimators pay a certain price in terms of efficiency as highlighted by the
boxplots that show more variability compared to those of the standard estimator.
To assess how much is "lost" by the robust estimator compared to the classical
one in terms of efficiency, we consider one last simulation where we examine 
the performance of two estimators on data issued from the uncontaminated model,
i.e. $(X_t)$. Therefore, the only difference between this simulation and the 
previous one is the value of $\alpha$ set to $0$, the code shall thus be omitted
and the results are depicted below:

```{r simulationRobust3, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 7}
```
 
It can be observed that both estimators provide extremely similar results
although the robust estimator is slightly more variable.

Next, we consider the issue of robustness on the real data set coming from the
domain of hydrology presented in Section \@ref(eda). This data concerns monthly
precipitation (in mm) over a certain period of time (1907 to 1972). Let us 
compare the standard and robust estimators of the autocorrelation functions:

```{r hydro_ACF, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}
```

It can be seen that, under certain assumptions (e.g. linear dependence), the 
standard estimator does not detect any significant autocorrelation between lags
since the estimations all lie within the asymptotic confidence intervals. However,
many of the robust estimations lie outside these confidence intervals at different 
lags indicating that there could be dependence within the data. If one were only to
rely on the standard estimator in this case, there may be erroneous conclusions
drawn on this data. Robustness issues therefore need to be considered for any 
time series analysis, not only when estimating the 
autocorrelation (autocovariance) functions.

Finally, we return to S&P 500 returns and compare the classical and robust
autocorrelation estimators, which are presented in the figure below.

```{r GSPCracf, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}
```

It can be observed that both estimators are very similar. Nevertheless, some
small discrepancies can be observed, in particular, the robust estimators seems
to indicate an absence of linear dependence while a slightly different
interpretation might be achieved with the classical estimator.


## Joint Stationarity

The notion of joint stationarity implies that the time series under
investigation is bivariate in nature, e.g. $\left(X_t \right)$ and 
$\left(Y_t\right)$ are two distinct time series with matching time points.
In order to fulfill bivariate stationarity, both processes
must be considered to be weakly stationary (constant mean and autocovariance
depends on lag $h$) as well as a cross-covariance function depend only on lag $h$.
The ideas discussed next can extended beyond the bivariate case to a general 
multivariate setting.

```{definition, label="crosscov"}
The **cross-covariance** function of two jointly stationary processes
$\left\{X_t\right\}$ and $\left\{Y_t\right\}$ is given by:

\[{\gamma _{XY}}\left( {t + h,t} \right) = \cov\left( {{X_{t+h}},{Y_{t}}} \right) =
\e{\left( {{X_{t + h}} - {\mu _X}} \right)\left( {{Y_t} - {\mu _Y}} \right)} = {\gamma _{XY}}\left( h \right)\]
```

Unlike the symmetry found in the autocovariance function of a stationary
process $\left\{X_t\right\}$, e.g. $\gamma_X(h) = \gamma_X(-h)$, the cross-covariance
function is only equal when $\gamma_{XY}(h) = \gamma_{YX}(-h)$. Notice the
switch in indices and negative lag change.

```{definition, label="crosscorr"}
The *cross-correlation* function for two jointly stationary time series
$\left\{X_t\right\}$ and $\left\{Y_t\right\}$ can be expressed as:

\[{\rho _{XY}}\left( {t+h,t} \right) = \frac{{{\gamma _{XY}}\left( {t + h,t} \right)}}{{\sqrt {{\gamma _X}\left( 0 \right)} \sqrt {{\gamma _Y}\left( 0 \right)} }} = \frac{{{\gamma _{XY}}\left( h \right)}}{{{\sigma _{{X_{t+h}}}}{\sigma _{{Y_{t}}}}}} = {\rho _{XY}}\left( h \right)\]
```

Due to the previously discussed symmetry regarding the cross-covariance function,
note that the cross-correlation function also only has equality when 
$\rho_{XY}(h) = \rho_{YX}(-h)$. Thus, note that $\rho_{XY}(h) \neq \rho_{XY}(-h)$.

```{example, label="ccfjs"}
Consider two time series processes given by:

\[\begin{aligned}
  {X_t} &= {W_t} - {W_{t-1}} \\
  {Y_t} &= {W_t} + {W_{t-1}} \\ 
\end{aligned} \]

where $W_t \sim WN(0, \sigma^2_W)$.

First check to see if $\left\{X_t\right\}$ and $\left\{Y_t\right\}$ are weakly stationary.

The means of both time series are evident to be
\[\begin{aligned}
  E\left[ {{X_t}} \right] &= E\left[ {{Y_t}} \right] = 0 \\
\end{aligned} \]

The autocovariance for $\left\{X_t\right\}$ is given as:

\[\begin{aligned}
  {\gamma _X}\left( h \right) &= \cov \left( {{X_{t + h}},{X_t}} \right) \\
   &= \cov \left( {{W_{t + h}} - {W_{t + h - 1}},{W_t} - {W_{t - 1}}} \right) \\
   &= {1_{\left\{ {h = 0} \right\}}}2{\sigma ^2} + {1_{\left\{ {h =  - 1} \right\}}}{-\sigma ^2} + {1_{\left\{ {h = 1} \right\}}}{-\sigma ^2} \\
   &= \begin{cases}
   2\sigma^2_W, &\text{if} h = 0 \\
   -\sigma^2_W, &\text{if} \left|h\right| = 1 \\
   0, &\text{if} \left|h\right| \ge 1 
   \end{cases} 
\end{aligned} \]

Similarly, the autocovariance for $\left\{Y_t\right\}$ is calculated to be:

\[\begin{aligned}
  {\gamma _Y}\left( h \right) &= \cov \left( {{Y_{t + h}},{Y_t}} \right) \\
   &= \cov \left( {{W_{t + h}} + {W_{t + h - 1}},{W_t} + {W_{t - 1}}} \right) \\
   &= {1_{\left\{ {h = 0} \right\}}}2{\sigma ^2} + {1_{\left\{ {h =  - 1} \right\}}}{\sigma ^2} + {1_{\left\{ {h = 1} \right\}}}{\sigma ^2} \\ 
   &= \begin{cases}
   2\sigma^2_W, &\text{if} h = 0 \\
   \sigma^2_W, &\text{if} \left|h\right| = 1 \\
   0, &\text{if} \left|h\right| \ge 1 
   \end{cases} 
\end{aligned} \]

Next, the cross-covariance for $\left\{X_t\right\}$ and $\left\{Y_t\right\}$:

\[\begin{aligned}
{\gamma _{XY}}\left( h \right) &= \cov \left( {{X_{t + h}},{Y_t}} \right) \\
   &= \cov \left( {{W_{t + h}} - {W_{t + h - 1}},{W_t} + {W_{t-1}}} \right)  \\ 
   &= \begin{cases}
   0, &\text{if } h = 0 \\
   -\sigma^2_W, &\text{if } h = 1 \\
   \sigma^2_W, &\text{if } h = -1 \\
    0, &\text{if } h \ge 2
   \end{cases}
\end{aligned}\]

Therefore, based on obtain the weak stationarity for each process and obtain a
cross-covariance function that only depends on the lag $h$, the process is
joint stationary. 

Furthermore, we also have the cross-correlation function as:

\[{\rho _{XY}}\left( {{X_{t + h}},{Y_t}} \right) = \frac{{{\gamma _{XY}}\left( h \right)}}{{{\sigma _X}{\sigma _Y}}} = \frac{{{\gamma _{XY}}\left( h \right)}}{{\sqrt {{\gamma _x}\left( 0 \right)} \sqrt {{\gamma _y}\left( 0 \right)} }} = \frac{{{\gamma _{XY}}\left( h \right)}}{{{\gamma _X}\left( 0 \right)}} = \begin{cases}
   0, &\text{if } h = 0 \\
   -\frac{1}{2}, &\text{if } h = 1 \\
   \frac{1}{2}, &\text{if } h = -1 \\
    0, &\text{if } h \ge 2
   \end{cases}\]
```

### Sample Cross-Covariance and Cross-Correlation Functions

A natural estimator of the *cross-covariance function* is given by:

\[{{\hat \gamma }_{XY}}\left( h \right) = \frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^{T - h} {\left( {{X_{t + h}} - \bar X} \right)\left( {{Y_t} - \bar Y} \right)} \]

With this in mind, the "plug-in" estimator for the *cross-correlation function*
follows:

\[{{\hat \rho }_{XY}}\left( h \right) = \frac{{{{\hat \gamma }_{XY}}\left( h \right)}}{{\sqrt {{{\hat \gamma }_X}\left( 0 \right)} \sqrt {{{\hat \gamma }_Y}\left( 0 \right)} }}\]

Both of the above estimators are again only symmetric under the above index
and lag transformation.


## Portmanteau test

In this section we give a brief introduction to Portmanteau tests used in time
series analysis. In linear regression, we always need to do diagnostic test for
residuals after building our model, to check whether our assumptions are 
satisfied. If there is no evidence to reject any of the assumptions, we can say
that the linear model we built is adequate. Otherwise, the linear models are not
adequate, some modifications or transformations need to be done either for the
previous model or for the data. This rule also applies to time series modeling.
In time series analysis, a wide variety of Portmanteau tests can be used to 
check the white noise residuals assumption. We will introduce two of them as 
follows, which are based on the ACF of residuals, in order to illustrate some 
of ideas of this kind of tests.

Dating back to 1970, Box and Pierce proposed the well-known Box-Pierce test
statistic as the following form:

$$Q_{BP} = n\sum_{h =1}^m \hat{\rho}_h^2,$$

where the empirical autocorrelation of residuals at lag $h$ is defined
as $\hat{\rho}_h = \frac{\hat{\gamma}(h)}{\hat{\gamma}(0)}$. It is obvious that
under alternative hypothesis, $\hat{\rho}_h$ would be deviate from $0$, thus a
large $Q_{BP}$ gives us the evidence to reject the null. And under null
hypothesis that the residuals are white noise (or equivalently the time series 
are adequate), it can be shown that when $n \to \infty$, we have

$$Q_{BP} \overset{\mathcal{D}}{\to} \chi^2_{m - m^{\prime}},$$
where $m^{\prime}$ is the number of parameters in the time series model.

## Proof
We can write the autocorrelation $\bm{\rho} = \left(\rho(1), \rho(2), \dots, \rho(m)\right)^T$, and the sample autocorrelation $\bm{\hat{\rho}} = \left(\hat{\rho}(1), \hat{\rho}(2), \dots, \hat{\rho}(m)\right)^T$.

According to the Theorem A.7 on textbook, under the data generating process $X_t = W_t + \mu$, where $\mu < \infty$ and $(W_t)$ is a strong white noise process with variance $\sigma^2$ and finite fourth moment (i.e. $\mathbb{E} [W_t^4] < \infty$), we have 
$$\sqrt{n} \left(\mathbf{\hat{\rho}} - \mathbf{\rho}\right) \overset{\mathcal{D}}{\to} V,$$
where the $(p,q)^{th}$ element of $V$ is
$$v_{pq} = \sum_{u=1}^{\infty}\left[ \rho(u+p) + \rho(u-p) - 2\rho(p)\rho(u) \right] \times \left[ \rho(u+p) + \rho(u-p) - 2\rho(p)\rho(u) \right].$$
And since $V$ is positive definite covariance matrix, therefore,
$$\sqrt{n} V^{-\frac{1}{2}}\left(\mathbf{\hat{\rho}} - \mathbf{\rho}\right) \overset{\mathcal{D}}{\to} \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, I),$$
and also
$$n \left(\mathbf{\hat{\rho}} - \mathbf{\rho}\right)^T V^{-1} \left(\mathbf{\hat{\rho}} - \mathbf{\rho}\right) \overset{\mathcal{D}}{\to} \chi^2_m,$$
Since under the null, $\mathbf{\rho} = \mathbf{0}$, we have 
$$v_{pq} = 
\begin{cases}
0, \; p \neq q\\
1, \; p = q
\end{cases}
.$$

Thus, it's easy to show that the Box and Pierce test statistic 
$$Q_{BP} = n\sum_{h =1}^m \hat{\rho}_h^2,$$
under that data generating process would follow a $\chi^2$ distribution 
with $m$ degree of freedom.

Before, we suppose that we know $\mu$ in our data generating process exactly,
so that no unknown parameter needs to be estimated. Now, suppose $\mu$ is
unknown and contains $m^{\prime}$ number of unknown parameters which we have 
to estimate. As we know, if our model for $\mu$ is correctly specified and
those $m^{\prime}$ unknown parameters are appropriately estimated, then the 
underlying model of the residules of the fitted model would be $W_t$ as before,
but the $m^{\prime}$ number of true parameters are replaced by their estimators.
Then $Q_{BP}$ will still asymptotically follows $\chi^2$ but
with $m - m^{\prime}$ degree of freedom. $\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \blacksquare$


Then on 1978, Ljung and Box improved Box-Pierce test by standardizing
each $\hat{\rho}_h$ by its asymptotic variance. The Ljung and Box test
statistic is

$$Q_{LB} = n\sum_{h =1}^m \frac{n+2}{n-h}\hat{\rho}_h^2.$$

It can also be shown that $Q_{LB} \overset{\mathcal{D}}{\to} \chi^2_{m - m^{\prime}}$ under
the null. However, compared to $Q_{BP}$, the distribution of $Q_{BP}$ under the
null is closer to $\chi^2_{m - m^{\prime}}$, when $n$ is finite.

In the above two examples, the test statistic contains a user specified
parameter $m$. And for different $m$, the power of the test would be different.
Thus many work has been done to either select the optimal $m$, or propose a new
test statistic without user specified parameters. Moreover, testing white noise 
can also be done by checking PACF, or by checking the spectral density in the
frequency domain. Therefore these lead to many different Portmanteau tests.

Take for an example the following use of a Portmanteau test to show the 
distribution of test statistics under the null:

```{r dist_null_portmanteau, cache = TRUE}
```

From the histogram, we can see that under the null the distribution of both BP
and LB are close to Chi-square distribution, but LP is slightly better.

To show the distribution of P-values under different alternatives and
show that the test depends on specified $m$.

```{r alternatives_port, cache = TRUE}
```

## Exercises

1. Given three random variables $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$ such that $\mathbb{\mu}  = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} 1 \\ 0 \\ { - 2} \end{array}} \right]$ and $\mathbb{\Sigma} = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} 2&0&{ - 1} \\ 0&3&{0.5} \\ { - 1}&{0.5}&1 \end{array}} \right]$ compute:

    - $\var(X_2 + X_3)$

    - $\corr(X_3 + X_2, 2X_2 - 3X_1)$
1. Consider the time series of ${X_t} = {X_{t - 1}} + {W_t}$, where $W_t \sim N(0,\sigma ^2)$ and ${X_0} = 0$. Let $\bar X = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{X_i}}$. Derive the general form for $\var(\bar X)$. (Hint: $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{i^2}}  = \frac{{n\left( {n + 1} \right)\left( {2n + 1} \right)}}{6}$)
1. For each of the following first construct an example and then show that it has the correct properties:
    - $(X_t)$ with constant mean but has a variance that is a function of time.
    - $(W_t)$ white noise process that is not strongly stationary.
    - $(Z_t)$ a stationary process that has an autocovariance function whose lag does not go to zero as $h > 0$.
    - $(V_t)$ that is nonstationary with an autocovariance function that depends on the lag as $h > 0$.
